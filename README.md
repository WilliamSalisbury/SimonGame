This is a simple Simon game, where a user needs to memorize the pattern. It's a fun little game so give it a go and tell me what you think.

It mainly uses JavaScript and it was part of a web development course. I used the starting code to learn more about Javascript and made changes and improvements to make it more Phone friendly. It uses Math.random to generate a gamePattern and compares it to the userClickedPattern, if you got it right it goes to the next level if not you need to start over. 

It still needs work and like all projects I have more ideas and things I would like to improve such as displaying the gamePattern with the correlating sound and flash.
